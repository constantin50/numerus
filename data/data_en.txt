en,pq9LcwC7CoY,668,90,were following this dynamic you say rotate that vector 90 degrees which if we're drawing a vector field we often#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,797,0,you correctly said that this would get you at the coordinates 0 1 it's essentially walking you a quarter of the#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,868,90,back to our formula and we're asking in what sense do two 90-degree rotations combined to make e to the negative PI#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,879,90,dynamics here as each one of your velocity vectors is a 90-degree rotation of your position this base I the way#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,898,90,expression according to the idea that your velocity is always a 90 degree rotation of your position okay so that's#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,910,90,eyes at play we have this base which is describing the 90 degrees that we walk around the circle we have the eye that's#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,916,90,sitting here which is describing the rule of rotating your velocity vector 90 degrees but now we're going to introduce#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,986,90,we looked at every velocity vector and we said rotate another 90 degrees so that in this context it would actually#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1024,90,those vectors take wherever you are and rotate another 90 degrees counterclockwise they would all be#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1128,90,little bit of intuition for in what sense do two 90-degree rotations combine to get you this very specific value one#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1246,90,be more accurate to say that I to the power I is I different 90-degree rotations not two 90-degree rotations#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1249,90,power I is I different 90-degree rotations not two 90-degree rotations after all it's multiplying by I that's#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1297,3,context of counting numbers you know if N and K are just things like 3 & 5 we know that it should satisfy this idea of#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1478,5,multiply to become negative and we'd be looking at e to the negative 5 PI halves which is a very different number right#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1511,0,what are you right are you about a fifth like we saw before around 0.2 or are you this much smaller number and in terms of#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1731,25,some number X such that when you square it you get 25 well there's two different answers to that who's to say that our#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1739,5,root function is positive gives us a positive number rather than negative 5 so we have one expression that seems#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1752,16,of square roots what if I was asking for the fourth root of something like 16 usually we would think of this as#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1757,2,usually we would think of this as positive number two right 2 is a number such that when you multiply by itself#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1761,16,such that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16 seems like a decent answer to a fourth root but if#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1769,16,question what number the fourth equals 16 there there is another answer to this we could also say#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1775,2,another answer to this we could also say negative 2 that's a number that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1777,16,negative 2 that's a number that when you multiply by itself four times you get 16 but there's another answer you could say#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1847,90,multiple different answers you know we think of I again as this 90 90 degree rotation and if we were thinking of it#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1851,90,rotation and if we were thinking of it as a 90 degree rotation it feels like the square root should be you know#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1856,45,the square root should be you know something sitting at a 45 degree angle maybe that's the square root of I which#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1862,2,we could write out very explicitly as root 2 over 2 root 2 over 2 I that's just using trigonometry but if we were#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1872,270,thinking of I instead as being a negative 270 degree rotation it feels like half of that doing half of that#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1943,2,kind of define it to be the square root of 2 all is well and good but what if I said let's approach this the same way#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1956,1,things as e to the something right and then I'm going to raise that to the 1/2 by multiplying the 1/2 into the exponent#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1966,2,that e to the what is equal to 2 well that's the natural log of 2 it's a constant which is around zero point six#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,1977,2,we'll get to so we could be thinking of this as e to the natural log of 2 times one-half and if you wanted to if you#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2025,2,might seem funny but we could write it as e to the natural log of 2 plus 2 pi I that whole thing raised to the one-half#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2090,1,and quite famously e to the PI I is negative 1 so in this case it seems to be suggesting that if we are solving#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2103,1,could plug in for something like e to the X equaling 1/2 what we end up with is another answer what we might#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2231,131,that you want it to answer so it looks like 131 of you have entered the variant where we take Ln of 2 and we add 2 hyah#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2249,2,like oh it's red you got it wrong when you entered Ln of 2 plus 42 I pi which is of course a great choice but you#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2255,4,is of course a great choice but you could also have something like 4 pi plus the natural log of 2 or 6 pi I or really#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2257,2,could also have something like 4 pi plus the natural log of 2 or 6 pi I or really any integer multiple of 2 pi I if you#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2260,2,the natural log of 2 or 6 pi I or really any integer multiple of 2 pi I if you add that it doesn't affect e to the X#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2268,2,because it just has the effect of multiplying by e to the 2 pi which is the effect of multiplying by 1 and again#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2270,1,multiplying by e to the 2 pi which is the effect of multiplying by 1 and again this has kind of a funny consequence#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2283,2,most common entered expression there was that we might replace 2 so let's think we're thinking 2 to the power of one#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2286,2,that we might replace 2 so let's think we're thinking 2 to the power of one fourth okay there was a suggestion that#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2290,2,fourth okay there was a suggestion that we replaced 2 with e to the natural log of 2 plus 4 PI I okay plus 4 PI and we#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2294,2,we replaced 2 with e to the natural log of 2 plus 4 PI I okay plus 4 PI and we raise all of that to the 1/4 all right#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2302,1,of 2 plus 4 PI I okay plus 4 PI and we raise all of that to the 1/4 all right well if you were to play the same game#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2306,2,well if you were to play the same game you would get e to the natural log of 2 times 1/4 and we'd be multiplying by e#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2310,1,you would get e to the natural log of 2 times 1/4 and we'd be multiplying by e to the PI I now the first part of that#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2412,2,kind of base whether that base is I whether that base is 2 whatever it might be and one way that we might think about#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2440,2,you can choose to express any exponential as a base to X like 2 to the X or you could express that same#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2554,1,log of two what this means is that X both 1 is about 2 and so this corresponds with the function that we#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2558,2,corresponds with the function that we would usually write as 2 to the power X right okay and basically as I change#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2568,3,change it to something so that it looks like 3 so around 1.1 that exponential looks like 3 which we would usually#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2571,3,like 3 so around 1.1 that exponential looks like 3 which we would usually write as 3 to the power X I would like#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2573,3,looks like 3 which we would usually write as 3 to the power X I would like to argue that it's a little bit#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2598,6,X above R times X where maybe are something like zero point 6 9 but I could shift that down by 2 pi I and that#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2601,2,something like zero point 6 9 but I could shift that down by 2 pi I and that doesn't change the base that it would#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2608,2,that would still correspond to two or it could shift it up by 2 pi that doesn't change the base that it corresponds to#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2613,1,because in all of those cases when we plug in x equals 1 we get the same thing however all of these for different#

en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2705,2,that well you're usually taught that 2 to the 1/2 should be something where you know#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2708,1,well you're usually taught that 2 to the 1/2 should be something where you know if I multiply it by itself and this#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2719,2,where we're able to add things in that exponent I should get 2 to the 1 so it should be some number that when I#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2724,2,should be some number that when I multiply it by itself I get 2 and you know at that point you have a choice#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2737,2,this same deal if we asked about negative numbers what should 2 to the name#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2765,2,equals F of a times F of B and moreover the fact that the base is 2 is basically telling us that it's not just any such#
en,pq9LcwC7CoY,2771,1,function it's a function where when we plug in 1 we get 2 and just as a little you know sanity check style question to#

en,elQVZLLiod4,461,19,number of digits that are in it so the number we have there is a 19000 digit expression just monstrously huge and if#

en,elQVZLLiod4,470,19,this turning a into 2 to the power of that 19000 digit monstrosity you would not be able to store the information#
en,elQVZLLiod4,492,6,kind of information so just a power tower of height 6 and it's it's well beyond what you can literally physically#
en,elQVZLLiod4,502,2,ask how quickly does this thing blow up for other numbers if it's not 2 and one thing that I'm gonna ask you actually#
en,elQVZLLiod4,540,10,repeat this operation before the value of the expression has more than 10 digits so with 2 we had to get to a#
en,elQVZLLiod4,542,2,of the expression has more than 10 digits so with 2 we had to get to a tower of size 5 before that happened it#
en,elQVZLLiod4,545,5,digits so with 2 we had to get to a tower of size 5 before that happened it had jumped from being a 5 digit number#
en,elQVZLLiod4,548,5,tower of size 5 before that happened it had jumped from being a 5 digit number to a 19000 digit number so how many#
en,elQVZLLiod4,550,19,had jumped from being a 5 digit number to a 19000 digit number so how many times would you have to do it for a#
en,elQVZLLiod4,554,1,times would you have to do it for a value of B equals 1.1 and I'll give you a moment to answer that while we listen#
en,elQVZLLiod4,576,1,on over here get back into my terminal let's say I started a at a value of 1 let's just do this in a for loop so for#
en,elQVZLLiod4,581,50,let's just do this in a for loop so for N and some kind of range like 50 I'm gonna reassign a what if instead of#
en,elQVZLLiod4,588,1,doing repeated exponentiation I was just repeatedly multiplying it by 1 point 1 so just repeated multiplication which#
en,elQVZLLiod4,598,50,sense of how quickly that grows and if we take a look here at the first 50 values you know it starts at one point#
en,elQVZLLiod4,606,10,each stage it's actually growing just by a little bit by 10% with each jump and you get classic exponential growth so#
en,elQVZLLiod4,610,50,you get classic exponential growth so with 50 steps it took us up to 117 that's that's exponential growth so you#
en,elQVZLLiod4,687,1,should set a to be one again I'm going to repeatedly turn it into 1 ^ itself and what we get is a little bit of#
en,elQVZLLiod4,695,20,initial growth but it quickly slows down and just within 20 iterations it actually stays fixed at this value you#
en,elQVZLLiod4,712,1,the power of this thing that's one point 1 1 1 and 7 yeah don't type it too many times that actually stays fixed you get#
en,elQVZLLiod4,723,1,another way that we can phrase this is to say that the equation 1 point 1 to the power x equals x something where#
en,elQVZLLiod4,737,2,this didn't this didn't hold when we were doing with 2 if we had 2 to the x equals x if you try to think through#
en,elQVZLLiod4,745,0,equation to think about but if you just try out some values like 0 and 1 or anything in between you'll find there's#
en,elQVZLLiod4,753,2,in this case and what that means for our in an iterative process if instead of 2 at the base it was 1 point 1 at the base#
en,elQVZLLiod4,755,1,in an iterative process if instead of 2 at the base it was 1 point 1 at the base you'd have the situation where the#
en,elQVZLLiod4,760,1,you'd have the situation where the previous value you raise 1.1 to that it just stays fixed and now this starts#
en,elQVZLLiod4,769,1,first of all where's the switch what between what number between 1 and 2 is the point where it goes from staying#
en,elQVZLLiod4,777,2,incredibly quickly at that remember with 2 it only took us 5 iterations before we had something that#
en,elQVZLLiod4,807,1,forever in the same way that evidently I can do with a base of 1.1 can I find a value of X where this converges for#
en,elQVZLLiod4,813,4,value of X where this converges for example to 4 this is the question posed in the thumbnail of the video and what#
en,elQVZLLiod4,819,1,we just saw is that we could find a value that converges to 1 point 1 1 1 7 8 to on and on that's evidently a value#
en,elQVZLLiod4,822,8,value that converges to 1 point 1 1 1 7 8 to on and on that's evidently a value you can converge to and the solution#
en,elQVZLLiod4,826,1,you can converge to and the solution would be 1 point 1 but how do you go the other way around how can we actually#
en,elQVZLLiod4,833,4,solve for the idea that we can find a value of x that equals 4 and there's a clever trick here the you might spot and#
en,elQVZLLiod4,854,1,a genuine copy of itself it's not it doesn't have a height of 1 minus whatever the previous height was because#
en,elQVZLLiod4,862,4,assumption that the whole power tower equals 4 I could replace that with a 4 and solve X to the 4th equals 4 let's#
en,elQVZLLiod4,865,4,equals 4 I could replace that with a 4 and solve X to the 4th equals 4 let's see what would that be if I take square#
en,elQVZLLiod4,872,2,roots that's the same as saying x squared equals 2 so it looks like interesting x equals square root of 2#
en,elQVZLLiod4,874,2,squared equals 2 so it looks like interesting x equals square root of 2 gives me a power tower that should#
en,elQVZLLiod4,881,4,gives me a power tower that should converge to 4 kind of funky the idea that anything converges at all is sort#
en,elQVZLLiod4,887,2,of weird but the idea that you know square root of 2 would go to a clean value like an integer that's kind of#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1009,2,landed on the correct answer which is in fact the square root of 2 which is kind of a funny thing because if we go when#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1020,2,have this infinite power tower and we're assuming that it equals 2 and we recognize the self similarity like is#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1027,2,the power tower a copy of it in itself so that should mean x squared equals 2 that means x equals the square root of 2#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1029,2,so that should mean x squared equals 2 that means x equals the square root of 2 well hang on a second this can't be#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1040,2,tower converges to two when the base is root 2 but on the other hand it converges to 4 when the vase is root 2#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1042,4,root 2 but on the other hand it converges to 4 when the vase is root 2 it can't be both we've got a very#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1061,1ends up being so I'll hop back over i will reassign my variable a to be 1 I'm gonna make my little loop actually let's#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1068,4,import math because I'm gonna need a square root here so I'm gonna say 4 I don't know I'll just do 20 at a time I'm#

en,elQVZLLiod4,1086,20,really matter and it looks like for those first 20 iterations does kind of slow down as it approaches#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1089,20,does kind of slow down as it approaches to and if I do another 20 iterations it's definitely slowing down as it gets#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1103,22,like it lands exactly on two but then it jumps up 22.000 for which if you think through what's going on here at some#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1214,1,cobweb diagram and the way this will work is I have an initial value of 1 as the input and then the next value is#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1219,1,the input and then the next value is going to be whatever F of 1 I'm gonna plug in one to the function#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1226,2,and what that means is I move vertically until I hit the graph and in this case 2 to the 1 is just 2 so I'm gonna hit it#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1229,1,until I hit the graph and in this case 2 to the 1 is just 2 so I'm gonna hit it at a y-value of 2 but from there what I#

en,elQVZLLiod4,1235,2,want is the output that I just got that 2 to become an input to the function but if outputs are represented on the#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1252,2,same as the x value I'll get to a point where 2 is the x value where it can now think of that 2 as being the input and#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1255,2,where 2 is the x value where it can now think of that 2 as being the input and to do that I walk until I hit the line y#

en,elQVZLLiod4,1293,16,moving vertically until I hit the graph again and this time it's not until 16 that I hit the graph and then I move to#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1297,16,that I hit the graph and then I move to the right until x also equals 16 and then from there I have to go quite a#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1307,65,but it will happen quite a while and around 65000 it intersects the graph again and then it's going to move to the#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1313,65,right until we get to an x coordinate that's also 65000 and from there desmos just totally gives up on trying to draw#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1325,19,where the number describing that height is a 19000 digit number so it just it just gives up on us there but when we#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1351,1,yeah they absolutely cross but even up to around 1.4 one which is around the square root of 2#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1354,2,to around 1.4 one which is around the square root of 2 if you look at what happens with this#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1376,2,equal to X and in particular if that base was the square root of 2 and I say find a solution of square root of 2 to#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1379,2,base was the square root of 2 and I say find a solution of square root of 2 to the power x equals x you know it's not#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1389,2,case you would believe me if I told you that the solution is x equals 2 you can just plug that in and solve it so if we#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1398,2,ahead and make it precisely the square root of 2 rather than just an approximation here so B is going to be#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1401,2,approximation here so B is going to be the square root square root of 2 know of to the intersection point is exactly at#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1408,2,to the intersection point is exactly at 2 so you see your iterative process approaching that okay that's kind of#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1458,1,this case is B to the X intersects at a slope that's less than 1 and we can think about why that's true if I turn a#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1481,1,intersects it but with a slope greater than 1 then when we do our iterative process we'll have some output and we#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1563,1,to infinity so that's that's always fun but I'll change that back to a 1 can take a look at my little note for being#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1579,4,that's kind of fun here is at one point 4 or 5 which seems just above a point where they actually intersect you have#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1599,1,taken the same process we did before where a starts out at 1 we're gonna do a bunch of iterative exponentiating but#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1608,50,five instead and I don't let's give ourselves like 50 values for this one the process okay eventually it blows up#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1626,2,seem to be moving that much in the to point you know the 2.71828 region for some reason around there it just seems#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1639,39,the four region there's two values then six and the nine and then 39 and then it just blows up to two million after that#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1783,2,think about it for numbers even numbers like 2 & 3 the idea of repeating this process some number of times is just#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1811,41,constant so would recommend alright so next we have 41.1 to the power x equals x Wolfram Alpha yields two real#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1845,38,but it's not a stable fixed point so up here is that 38th value that you were just referencing and because it#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1950,1777,looking for a system of equations here and the correct answer which 1777 have you got I think that's not quite french#
en,elQVZLLiod4,1975,1,natural log of B and we want that slope to equal 1 because it's got to be the same as the slope of the graph we're#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2062,1,the natural log of B times itself is equal to 1 now to solve this the first thing I might do is note that I can#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2077,1,write the natural log of B times X is equal to 1 ok and what that gives me is that B is the same as 1 divided by X all#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2081,1,equal to 1 ok and what that gives me is that B is the same as 1 divided by X all very nice no no it doesn't give me that#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2090,1,it gives me that the natural log of B is 1 over X that is the same statement as saying e to the 1 over X is equal to B#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2094,1,1 over X that is the same statement as saying e to the 1 over X is equal to B alright now what does that buy us well#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2111,1,nothing but X's in it it'll be e to the 1 over X all to the power X I'm just replacing the B with what we found it to#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2120,1,be and that is supposed to equal X but on the other hand e to the 1 e to the 1 over X to the power X#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2123,1,on the other hand e to the 1 e to the 1 over X to the power X simplifies down to simply being e and#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2148,10,was solving this for some reason I was just confided for like 10 minutes where I got to this point I'm like that can't#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2213,1,so this would seem to imply that B is e to the power of 1 divided by e which is such a delightfully bizarre answer e to#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2218,1,such a delightfully bizarre answer e to the power of 1 divided by e and we can check with our calculator that that#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2227,1,here and I say hey desmos what is e to the 1 over e not 1 over 3 1 over e yeah checks out it is between one point four#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2245,1,I think finding that solution that it's e to the 1 over e as a challenge puzzle for you if you want a little bit of#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2261,1,playing with values of B that are less than 1 and if we do that I'll just kind of get rid of our cobweb here if we do#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2405,2,graphs happen at a y-value of two I guess it's also an x value of 2 because it's on the line y equals x but what we#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2411,2,care about is that the Y value should be 2 and you would be able to empirically start seeing that hmm it's somewhere#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2473,3,well I mean in in either case we'd be dealing with 3 3 different variables there's the idea of what's the what's#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2482,3,what's the output so in either case we just be having 3 of them the 4 in tetration like what makes it 4 is not#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2485,4,just be having 3 of them the 4 in tetration like what makes it 4 is not the fact that there's three relevant#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2497,4,process of addition multiplication exponentiation is kind of the 4th of our like repeating the process before#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2514,2,wonder what happens if instead of our base equaling 2 or instead of our base equaling square root of 2 or 1.4 or all#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2517,2,base equaling 2 or instead of our base equaling square root of 2 or 1.4 or all the values we were just looking at what#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2579,4,running across the middle of the screen from around negative 4.5 up to I think 3 and then the imaginary axis that's going#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2584,2,and then the imaginary axis that's going from I think like negative 2 I up to 2 I so this horizontal part of blackness#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2593,1,converge that we just found where the upper bound was e to the 1 over E and the lower bound is what you can find for#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2616,1,for complex numbers even if they're real part is greater than e to the 1 over E that imaginary part can conspire in just#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2784,63,understand that the maximum number of coins you can have ends up being 63 if you just sort of keep doing this process#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2792,63,coins doubling it but shifted one over you can get up to 63 now if I introduce the second magical operation which is#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2913,1,process when I said be equal to around 1.4 1 yeah it seems like nothing's really happening around the negative#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2920,2,really happening around the negative square root of 2 okay so let's try to understand#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2929,2,point so the reason we were taking square roots of 2 when we were looking at our power tower operations if we#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2944,2,whole thing no not with an X at the top it just goes up to infinity equals 2 we saw the reflection of itself x squared#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2949,2,saw the reflection of itself x squared equals 2 let's think about what this would mean what do we mean to have a#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2964,2,think about it if we set X equal to the negative square root of 2 then you'd be raising it in the next process you would#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2970,2,raising it in the next process you would take negative square root of 2 you would raise it to a negative power ok so#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2979,2,already in the realm of thinking about negative square root of 2 to the 1 over now negative 1 over square root of 2 to#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2982,1,negative square root of 2 to the 1 over now negative 1 over square root of 2 to the square root of 2 mm why doesn't that#
en,elQVZLLiod4,2987,2,now negative 1 over square root of 2 to the square root of 2 mm why doesn't that end up popping up in the intersection or#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3030,2,of for our logic fails if we just plug in square root of negative 2 I'm kind of curious if that breaks down numerically#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3038,1,so if we do try this over in our Python where let's again set equal to 1 let's find our for loop where now we're going#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3044,2,find our for loop where now we're going to do the negative square root of 2 and repeat the process yeah what do we get#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3056,2,we do get a stable point testing it's negative square root of 2 you look like you're a very stable point#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3063,2,you're not a stable point that's equal to 2 at all what is that number what's going on there you know what I I'm not#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3131,4,in the case of a power tower that equals 4 you could very clearly see why it didn't the assumption that it even#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3143,2,case our assumption would be if we had negative root 2 if we have a negative value that what's sitting up here is#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3148,2,value that what's sitting up here is still equal to 2 hmm I don't know we could we saw that it doesn't we can say#
en,elQVZLLiod4,3170,2,what's going on with the square root of negative 2 what does it converge to and why does it have any relation to this#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,735,1,all the odd numbers but it goes through every number so I'm gonna take 1 minus 1/2 plus 1/3 minus 1/4 on and on and you#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,813,6,approached a beautiful thing it was PI squared over 6 you might think an even more natural question to ask is don't#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,817,1,more natural question to ask is don't square them at all take 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/3 plus 1/4 on and on#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,3784,2,1/2 plus 1/3 minus 1/4 and the claim is that that was the natural log of 2 so let's see if we can try to understand#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,3905,3,taking x over 1 minus x squared over 2 plus X cubed over 3 on and on and on and I want to know in general what does this#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,3915,1,then I just have to plug in the value x equals 1 and like I said that might make it seem harder infinitely harder#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,3940,1,behaves quite nicely the derivative of X is 1 the derivative of x squared over 2 well that 2 hops down and cancels out#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,3943,2,is 1 the derivative of x squared over 2 well that 2 hops down and cancels out the denominator so it becomes negative X#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4047,1,kind of feels intuitive that if we take 1 plus 1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 you could even draw out a picture where let's say#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4058,1,I've got a rectangle whose side length is 1 and 1 here I can say the 1 represents this area and then 1/2#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4061,1,is 1 and 1 here I can say the 1 represents this area and then 1/2 represents this area and then 1/4#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4063,1,represents this area and then 1/2 represents this area and then 1/4 represents this area then 1/8 represents#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4066,1,represents this area and then 1/4 represents this area then 1/8 represents that area and kind of keep playing this#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4073,2,game and eventually it'll fill an area of 2 now the more general version of that is this geometric sum which someone#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4090,1,it so this whole thing ends up looking like 1/1 + x great but what this suggests is that if#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4125,0,here is the question what is the integral from 0 up to 1 of 1 divided by 1 plus X DX okay#

en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4217,1,of this you get 1 over the inside 1 over 1 plus X but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1 so it stays the#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4219,1,1 plus X but then the chain rule just has you multiplying by 1 so it stays the same so then we evaluate this at the#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4223,1,same so then we evaluate this at the bounds 1 and 0 and what this ends up getting us is the natural log at the top#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4231,1,getting us is the natural log at the top which is 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 1 plus X at the bottom which was 1#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4233,1,which is 1 plus 1 minus the natural log of 1 plus X at the bottom which was 1 plus 0 the natural log of 1 plus 1 is of#
en,4PDoT7jtxmw,4236,0,of 1 plus X at the bottom which was 1 plus 0 the natural log of 1 plus 1 is of course#

en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4376,100,second most important log rule we're asking how many times does 100 go into a million in a multiplicative sense how#

en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4684,5,the complexity level a lot here where if in lecture 5 I'm talking about like Euler's formula with complex numbers and#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4690,6,compound interest and like how that plays into physics and then lecture 6 we're back to the basics of logarithms I#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4700,2,but just continuing on with the answer if you note that e to the 2 pi times you know some number times I#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4719,0,circle and just keep repeating as n goes from 0 up to 1 it'll walk around one cycle and end up back where you started#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4723,1,cycle and end up back where you started as n goes from 1 to 2 you'll end up back where you started so for example e to#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4728,0,where you started so for example e to the 0 sits here e to the I pi is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi is also at#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4733,1,the 0 sits here e to the I pi is at negative 1 but e to the 2 pi is also at 1 same with e excuse me same with e to#

en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4745,4,1 same with e excuse me same with e to the 4 pi i that also equals 1 so in general if you wanted to ask something#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4751,1,general if you wanted to ask something like what is the log base e of 1 you know the one hand we want to say the log#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4759,1,know the one hand we want to say the log of log base anything of 1 should be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4761,0,of log base anything of 1 should be 0 because anything to the power 0 equals that 1 but if we're letting complex#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4763,1,because anything to the power 0 equals that 1 but if we're letting complex numbers into the mix you would have to#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4767,2,numbers into the mix you would have to honestly say well 2 pi is another pretty good answer to this question because e#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4772,2,good answer to this question because e to the 2 pi also equals 1 and same with 4 pi and you could even go in the#
en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4775,4,to the 2 pi also equals 1 and same with 4 pi and you could even go in the negative direction and in general n#

en,cEvgcoyZvB4,4905,1,go into the log of X in an additive sense yeah and well what is 1 divided by the log base 10 of 2 so we're going to#

en,IAEASE5GjdI,75,3,that we do throughout obviously 3b1b.co live is where you can go#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,172,1645,would take the imaginary interest rate um and then uh 1645 of you said no all right we'll see if you stand by that#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,226,12,different interest rates on your savings bank a will increase your savings by 12 every year okay pretty good bank bank b#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,399,12,is everyone who said c you know it's not obvious that 12 over a year is gonna be any different#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,406,12,like well one percent per month that should add up to 12 over the year um and i think it's it's worth just#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,446,112,we had twelve percent of that hundred dollars and sensibly enough you get 112. and a nice way to think about this which#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,469,100,changing means we can factor out this 100 and we can just say#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,476,1,multiplying it by a constant in this case that constant would be 1.12 so as you go from this step to the#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,484,12,your account balance doesn't jump by just 12 because it's also earning interest on the 12#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,486,12,just 12 because it's also earning interest on the 12 extra dollars that you got that last#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,489,125,extra dollars that you got that last year so it jumps up to 125. it's a multiplicative amount and this#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,508,10,curve and in fact if you look at 10 years in it looks like the y coordinate of that#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,512,310,it looks like the y coordinate of that is around 310. so you let your money sit in that savings account#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,516,12,in that savings account with 12 interest for 10 years and you'd end up with#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,636,3,the correct expression which it looks like 3000 of you got is that it should be a hundred dollars#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,640,0,it should be a hundred dollars times one plus 0.6 squared all right now let's think through why#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,650,12,working with if instead of increasing by 12 we're saying increase by 6 percent#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,653,6,if instead of increasing by 12 we're saying increase by 6 percent when you factor it out it looks like#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,659,1,multiplying by 1.06 okay and then there's two ways you can think about this if you're already#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,677,106,you can say let's repeat the process so this gets us 106 after that first six month period okay#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,680,106,after that first six month period okay we've got 106 then we're going to add 6 0.06#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,681,6,we've got 106 then we're going to add 6 0.06 times that 106 and that's going to get#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,684,106,then we're going to add 6 0.06 times that 106 and that's going to get us the final amount#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,689,106,us the final amount but this we can factor because 106 shows up in two places#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,697,106,this out as 106 times 1.06 and then you might realize oh wait i'm#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,737,1,saying we multiply by 1.01 okay by one plus that one percent um and then we do it after#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,743,12,one percent um and then we do it after 12 months okay so instead of the instead of the#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,747,112,okay so instead of the instead of the uh 112 dollars that you would have had from bank a#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,754,68,frequently got us an extra 68 cents in our account so#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,769,12,but if i just crank up this number n to 12 that's basically asking how many times#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,780,12,interest rate is so if the annual interest rate was 12 percent and you're making steps each 1 twelfth#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,781,1,interest rate was 12 percent and you're making steps each 1 twelfth of a month of a munch#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,798,112,the y coordinate of our graph is that 112 dollars with the extra 68 cents not quite a dollar more but it is more#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,812,10,and if you're curious you know previously after 10 years we would have had 310 dollars i think it#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,814,310,previously after 10 years we would have had 310 dollars i think it was#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,824,310,tenth all right this says 310 when we compound every month instead#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,828,120,every month instead and we wait for 120 months it looks like uh we've squeezed out an extra 20 bucks#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,831,20,and we wait for 120 months it looks like uh we've squeezed out an extra 20 bucks so#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,910,12,so maybe delta t is a 12th of a year or maybe it's one 365th of a year#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,912,365,is a 12th of a year or maybe it's one 365th of a year it depends on how finely we cut it and#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,943,0,of r as being something like the 0.12 from our example and then later on we're going to play around with#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,956,1,like 1 12 if we were compounding monthly because#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,961,12,simply by compounding monthly it doesn't mean you get to grow by 12 every month it means you grow by 1 12 of what the#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,963,1,mean you get to grow by 12 every month it means you grow by 1 12 of what the annual rate was#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,973,100,it's also proportional to the amount of money you had you know if you had 100 that grows by a certain amount if you#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,978,10,had a thousand dollars in there it grows by 10 times as much the more you have the more it grows okay#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,983,100,in our example you might think of as being something like 100 all right so what's the magic of this it#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1004,1,it lets us factor things out so that m factors out and we have 1 plus r delta t#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1026,0,with at time t equals 0 multiplied by this expression 1 plus r delta t#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1030,1,at time t equals 0 multiplied by this expression 1 plus r delta t and i'll change this in a moment but#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1068,1,the amount of money we started with times 1 plus r times the total time divided by n so#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1107,1,this function of x that looks like 1 plus 1 over n or maybe i'll say 1 plus#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1110,1,of x that looks like 1 plus 1 over n or maybe i'll say 1 plus x over n so we want to be able to plug#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1160,100,so let's say pull up the question here what happens to the value 100 times 1 plus 0.12 over n to the power#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1164,1,what happens to the value 100 times 1 plus 0.12 over n to the power n as the value of n approaches infinity#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1180,12,compound interest what we're basically saying is if you have that 12 interest rate and you want to wait one#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1186,12,but you chop up that year into n different pieces maybe n is 12 if you compound every month maybe n is#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1190,365,if you compound every month maybe n is 365 if you compound every day or maybe you#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1206,68,yearly to monthly that gave us an extra 68 cents so the question asks basically how high#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1353,1670,but don't view this as right or wrong uh it looks like 1670 of you correctly noted that this value would#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1358,112,correctly noted that this value would rise above 112 but never above 113 so maybe taking the instincts from the#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1366,68,when we went from yearly to monthly we only got 68 cents and saying you can't get much better than that#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1375,114,people who said it would rise above 114 but stay below some finite bound#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1419,1,that direction if i take 1 plus 0.12 over n and i raise this to the power n and i#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1427,100,say what happens as we increase n and 100 that's not big enough i want to let myself increase it to#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1430,100,to let myself increase it to some huge number uh you know 100 million so the value i want you to watch is#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1442,12,money you'll have if you compound your 12 interest much more frequently even as i'm cranking it up around 100 million#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1445,100,12 interest much more frequently even as i'm cranking it up around 100 million this value really stays stable around#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1450,1,this value really stays stable around 1.12 here let's multiply it by the hundred dollars to make it more#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1455,112,intuitive around the 112 dollars and you know 74 cents or about 75 cents#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1458,75,around the 112 dollars and you know 74 cents or about 75 cents it stays really stable around that even#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1470,10,numbers 10 to the 300th or grams constant or whatever big number you want#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1511,1,without an x in it so x divided by n will be the same as 1 divided by m and now i'll be raising that to the#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1529,1,think of that just as the quantity 1 plus 1 over m to the power m all raised to the x#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1554,100,that we were dealing with a real world problem with things like that 100 starting value or that uh 12 interest#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1556,12,problem with things like that 100 starting value or that uh 12 interest rate and we just have clean constants#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1560,1,rate and we just have clean constants like 1 for each of them it looks like this#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1565,2,value ends up to being around 2.71828 and and no matter how big you make n it seems to#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1601,2,value around 2.71828 okay and then we can write our whole#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1680,1,x which follows convention looks like well 1 plus#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1683,2,plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6 and all of the terms#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1685,6,x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6 and all of the terms look like x to the k divided by k#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1795,1,certain constant that's a little above 1 many many times and if you'll remember the reason we're#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1936,90,that when you multiply i by something it has the effect of a 90 degree rotation#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1951,90,idea of taking a vector and rotating it 90 degrees now what this means for us#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1984,90,vector that you've newly landed on and it rotates at 90 degrees okay and then you take a little step based on#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,1999,90,part and some imaginary part you rotate it 90 degrees and you add a little step on that#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2038,90,of the year you would add i times that amount which is a 90 degree rotation#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2056,100,dollars so if you had a hundred dollars in the bank you end up with 100 real dollars#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2065,90,vector rotates at 90 degrees and adds that to where you are#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2088,90,and you add another 90 degree rotation of where you currently are you're going to step#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2095,200,this point now you have negative 200 real dollars but you still have#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2098,200,but you still have that uh 200 imaginary uh imaginary dollars#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2126,100,well you owe us four hundred dollars for the 100 that you put in four years ago and just#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2144,90,if you keep playing this game of rotating 90 degrees and then adding that vector#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2147,8,that vector after a total of 8 years where you're going to end up#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2150,16,going to end up is at 16 times your original amount not too bad so if you're willing to put#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2165,16,eight total years you would have 16 times as much so that's pretty good i would say#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2277,100,well let's think it through what happens when you put in 100 to your savings account well if you wait#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2312,3,you wait a total of pi years around 3.14 years you come back and now it really doesn't look good now#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2336,16,you say okay i've i've seen this work out for my friends who got 16 times their money so#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2352,4,also can't even play monopoly well so 4.7 years is a real low during this whole experience#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2358,6,but if you're willing to stick it out and wait a total of 6.28 years two pie years you come back and for all#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2388,12,only relevant to real numbers you know a 12 interest rate um or if you have negative interest rates you can#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2692,2,this kind of side plot to the full lecture rotation in 2d requires one extra number#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2700,2,extra numbers i j k and not just 2 i and j for 3d rotation is there an equivalent way for rotation#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2723,2,and so you might say oh why do we need a 2d number system in order to describe something that only#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2753,3,degrees of freedom to describe any 3d rotation you might think of it as saying choose an#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2781,3,where somehow you associate the three degrees of freedom of 3d space with the three degrees of freedom of#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2800,3,higher to describe 3d rotations it's nice to have#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,2814,10,dimensions um rotations would actually have 10 degrees of freedom there's not a number system#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3112,1,negative i squared times v i squared is negative 1 so that's just going to end up being v#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3184,90,multiplying it by negative i which rotates at 90 degrees so this is a 90 degree angle#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3186,90,which rotates at 90 degrees so this is a 90 degree angle and then taking a little step and then#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3192,90,now you're at a new state and you rotate that new state by 90 degrees scale it down by delta t#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3318,90,change it's not in the direction of where you are it's 90 degrees to where you are times the time#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3393,1,the displacement well let's say the displacement started off entirely at 1 and the velocity was 0.#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3395,0,displacement started off entirely at 1 and the velocity was 0. what it would look like would just be#
en,IAEASE5GjdI,3492,90,of some number because this hooke's law let us describe things at a 90 degree angle#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1366,1,inputs so just as an example if we inputted something like negative 1 so the key here is to ask about multiplying#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1371,1,the key here is to ask about multiplying it by the value when you plug in 1 by this rule that addition in the input#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1381,0,turns into multiplication in the output that has to be the same as X of 0 now what is expo zero oh you know what I'm#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1409,1,them together the only term that matters is one so X book negative 1 times X plus 1 is equal to X plus 0 which is 1 so#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1467,1,does that imply well if we call X both 1/e that means we're asking what is the number which when you multiply by e#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1472,1,number which when you multiply by e equals 1 and it would be 1 divided by e but yeah and for the general case but we#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1479,0,need the added condition that when you plug in 0 you do get one now the point of all of this right the reason that I'm#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1501,1,means that because you can use the number 1 to access pretty much all the real numbers by adding it to itself or#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1525,1,that this polynomial can output in terms of what it outputs at the number 1 so you might read e to the X as just or#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1532,1,whatever this polynomial is at the input 1 we can start exponentiating in terms of that so that's the connection right#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1541,1,the number e to simply be where is this polynomial at the number 1 and then all of this would follow but I really want#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1669,1,f of X equals zero doesn't work with F of negative 1 equals 1 over F of 1 yeah f of X equals zero oh interesting yeah#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1698,1,guess that fact that F of negative 1 is 1 over F of 1 doesn't imply that the output will ever be 0 so I could ask for#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1701,0,1 over F of 1 doesn't imply that the output will ever be 0 so I could ask for some clarification but I think that#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1716,0,bit too much where the fact that expose 0 equals 1 gives us this other property and then Crispin Simmons says 3 is#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1718,3,0 equals 1 gives us this other property and then Crispin Simmons says 3 is included because f of X plus 0 oh ok#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1723,0,and then Crispin Simmons says 3 is included because f of X plus 0 oh ok yeah ok great#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1732,0,while live and on camera and under some pressure f of X plus 0 is the same as f of X times F of 0 which implies f of X#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1735,0,pressure f of X plus 0 is the same as f of X times F of 0 which implies f of X equals 1 awesome crispin you saved me he#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1867,90,multiplying by I has the effect of rotating 90 degrees if you multiply by I twice okay I squared you end up 180#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1890,90,pointing straight down multiplying by itself a fourth time 90 degrees takes us back to one so I to the fourth is 1 and#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1894,1,itself a fourth time 90 degrees takes us back to one so I to the fourth is 1 and then after that they all start repeating#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1903,4,where's that exponent with respect to powers of 4 if it's a power of 4 you're at 1 if it's 1 above a power 4 you're at#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1906,1,powers of 4 if it's a power of 4 you're at 1 if it's 1 above a power 4 you're at I now the the trickiness of the question#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1919,1,power means if we write something like I to the negative 1 that's defined to be 1 over I the number such that when you#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1925,1,over I the number such that when you multiply by it you get 1 and you can see that that's actually the same as I cubed#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1955,90,whole numbers just have us ticking forward by 90 degrees and finally we can have our fun okay we can take our crazy#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1985,1,going to give the name theta and then what that means is taking 1 plus I times theta plus I theta squared over 2 on and#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,1993,1,on and just as an example let's crank theta on up until it equals 1 and let's try to think pretty deeply about what#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2000,1,this actually means computationally the first term is 1 which we might draw with this green vector on the bottom pointed#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2007,1,one unit to the right the next term is going to be I times 1 so just I it's pointed straight up with magnitude 1 now#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2010,1,going to be I times 1 so just I it's pointed straight up with magnitude 1 now think about what the next term is it's#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2020,1,going to be I squared or I theta squared but theta is 1 so it's I squared which is negative 1 over 2 so that's why this#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2022,1,but theta is 1 so it's I squared which is negative 1 over 2 so that's why this next vector is pointed to the left and#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2027,1,next vector is pointed to the left and it has length 1/2 okay then after that I cubed is pointed straight down and we#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2033,6,cubed is pointed straight down and we divide it by 6 so now we just have an itty-bitty vector that is of magnitude#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2038,1,itty-bitty vector that is of magnitude 1/6 and then they just get smaller from there the next one is pointed to the#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2041,1,there the next one is pointed to the right but it has magnitude 1 over 24 and they just shrink a whole bunch and so we#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2111,0,visual you know that checks out it looks like the real part is a little above 0.5 so point five five four I believe that#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2202,3,to take the most famous input that there is plugging in PI around 3.14 let's think about what this is actually saying#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2208,1,think about what this is actually saying it's saying okay the first term is 1 so we've got our vector pointed 1 unit to#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2211,1,it's saying okay the first term is 1 so we've got our vector pointed 1 unit to the right the next term is I times pi#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2220,3,pointed up because of the I with the length of pie around 3.14 which it looks like it is the next one is going to be I#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2226,2,like it is the next one is going to be I squared times pi squared over 2 so that I squared means that it's negative okay#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2233,2,it's pointing to the left and I guess the magnitude is pi squared over 2 we could do a quick gut check if we wanted#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2239,9,and just ask ourselves you know what is what is pi squared it's around 9.8 same as the gravity on earth in terms of#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2246,2,meters per second squared which is always fun and dividing that by 2 it looks like it's 4.9 3 ok does that#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2249,4,always fun and dividing that by 2 it looks like it's 4.9 3 ok does that check out yeah I buy it that the the#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2257,5,length of this vector is just less than 5 so 4 point 9 3 and then the next one because of the I cubed is pointed down#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2262,6,because of the I cubed is pointed down and the magnitude is PI cubed over 6 evidently that's around the magnitude of#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2267,6,evidently that's around the magnitude of PI cubed over 6 and so far they've the vectors have been getting bigger but#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2280,4,an extra pie thrown in but the denominator now gets an extra 4 thrown in like going from 6 to 24 you're#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2282,6,denominator now gets an extra 4 thrown in like going from 6 to 24 you're multiplying by a 4 and then it's going#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2284,4,in like going from 6 to 24 you're multiplying by a 4 and then it's going to get an extra 5 and then a 6 so the#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2286,5,multiplying by a 4 and then it's going to get an extra 5 and then a 6 so the denominator is going to start growing#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2298,90,there is what's letting these vectors all turn 90 degrees each time and give us this very pretty spiral sum and the#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2320,1,right way that they land at the point negative 1 that's interesting still mysterious but mysterious in a good way#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2385,3,following values is closest to e to the 3 I okay so as usual this is the link you can go to which of the following#

en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2496,0,got well done well it done indeed and it's around negative 0.99 plus 0.1 4i and so the expectation isn't that you're#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2511,3,in values of theta and you ask what happens when you plug in 3 that the claim of Euler's formula is that we walk#
en,ZxYOEwM6Wbk,2542,2,to do with the number E has to do with the number 2.71828 on and on if we were to go to the computation taking place if#

en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,331,1,with complex numbers of the square root of negative 1 it's just trigonometry it's everything we were talking about#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,423,25,negative times a negative is a positive so I get 25 any number that you squares if it's positive#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,510,2,then there's one below negative I and you can have negative 2i you scale it however you want#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,572,4,have a number oh I don't know let me draw one here that's going to be 4 plus I ok and then I'm going to take a second#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,585,2,zero and this one is going to end up at negative 2 plus 2i so what I'm saying is you take the real number negative 2 and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,589,2,negative 2 plus 2i so what I'm saying is you take the real number negative 2 and then you move in that perpendicular#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,642,2,one that says you should consider to square root of 2 and negative 1 but not infinity so there's a good contingent of#

en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,795,2,vectors back at least when we're in the 2d plane you have some notions like cross products and dot products that in#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,829,3,have the point mmm 3 2 okay we're not even going to think of it as a complex member per se if I#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,838,3,and I go to the point with x-coordinate 3 and y coordinate 2 what is the 90 degree rotation of this if I rotate it#

en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,908,90,then I said where is that going to rotate to if I rotate it 90 degrees it's going to end up by swapping the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,915,90,coordinates B a and then making that first one negative that's a 90 degree rotation and a nice gut check here is to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,934,90,that first one becomes negative so that was another 90 degree rotation well what's happened here is we've just made#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,946,90,point sitting at a B and then I rotate it 90 degrees so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation and then another 90#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,949,90,it 90 degrees so this will be my initial 90 degree rotation and then another 90 degrees that's the same as 180 degree#

en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1031,2,swapping up whether you're taking 4 minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable we've got 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1033,2,minus 2 or 2 minus 4 so that's completely understandable we've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1036,3,completely understandable we've got 2 plus 3 which is maybe just dropping off the I so I think maybe a lot of like#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1059,3,ahead and skip ahead of it we know how to rotate something like 3 comma 2 so I'm not even going to give you time to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1098,3,want you to take the number I and I want you to multiply it by 3 plus 2i and even though I haven't really talked about the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1114,1,and then the defining feature of I is this idea that I squared is negative 1 that's the only special thing you need#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1177,3,like the majority of you answered negative two plus 3i which is absolutely correct absolutely correct#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1196,3,ourselves up our sheet if we take I times 3 plus 2 I 3 plus 2 I it just distributes I times 3 is going#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1201,3,times 3 plus 2 I 3 plus 2 I it just distributes I times 3 is going to be 3i I times 2i is going to be 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1204,3,it just distributes I times 3 is going to be 3i I times 2i is going to be 2 times I squared by definition I squared#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1212,1,times I squared by definition I squared is negative 1 which means that our final answer is#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1215,2,which means that our final answer is going to look like negative 2 plus 3i ok and like I said it looks like a#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1234,90,talked through was the fact that if you want to rotate numbers 90 degrees the rule is to swap the two coordinates and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1239,2,then multiply that first one by negative 2 well look it's what's happened here we've got 3 & 2 those coordinates have#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1241,3,2 well look it's what's happened here we've got 3 & 2 those coordinates have been swapped 2 is now the real part 3 is#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1244,2,we've got 3 & 2 those coordinates have been swapped 2 is now the real part 3 is the imaginary part but that 2 got#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1247,2,been swapped 2 is now the real part 3 is the imaginary part but that 2 got multiplied by a negative 1 because I has#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1249,1,the imaginary part but that 2 got multiplied by a negative 1 because I has this defining feature of squaring to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1253,1,this defining feature of squaring to become negative 1 so that should give you some indication that okay#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1259,90,multiplying by I has this action of rotating things by 90 degrees may that means that it's not a crazy thing#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1267,90,to do to geometrically position I at a 90 degree angle with the real number line okay#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1295,2,this case Z is going to be let's see where do I have it C is going to be a 2 plus I great and let's say I want to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1374,90,if I take Z times I from what we just talked about that is the 90-degree rotation what I might write is like#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1378,90,rotation what I might write is like rotate by 90 degrees the number Z okay so often our animation what does that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1388,90,multiplied by one we take I and then it's going to move to whatever the 90 degree rotation point for Z itself is#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1543,2,take a look at the question which says what is 2 plus I times 2 minus I and if you have notes right now if you have a#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1711,69,have been common misconceptions on this one 69 is close 0 i plus 5 is correct but I guess just formatted in a weird#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1743,2,inside parts I times two so that's going to be 2i and then the outside parts which is negative I times two so that's#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1748,2,which is negative I times two so that's negative 2i and then the last part which is I times negative I so that'll be#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1764,2,real component of our answer is going to be 2 times 2 or 4 now minus negative 1 which is plus 1 so that'll be 5 and then#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1767,1,be 2 times 2 or 4 now minus negative 1 which is plus 1 so that'll be 5 and then the imaginary parts cancel each other#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1772,2,the imaginary parts cancel each other out that 2i cancels out with a negative 2i so to everyone on the quiz who#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1774,2,out that 2i cancels out with a negative 2i so to everyone on the quiz who answered 5 plus 0 I you know extra#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1777,5,2i so to everyone on the quiz who answered 5 plus 0 I you know extra credit to you because that actually is a#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1942,30,multiplying by Z has the effect of rotating 30 degrees or pi/6 radians counterclockwise okay so you want to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1956,6,numbers the corresponding action is to rotate by pi/6 radians or 30 30 degrees okay great we've got a lot of answers#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1986,1,that I want is going to be whatever takes the number 1 to something that's the 30-degree rotation of the number 1#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,1988,30,takes the number 1 to something that's the 30-degree rotation of the number 1 it's it's up here whatever complex#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2010,6,and the correct answer in this context is d which is cosine of pi/6 plus I sine of pi/6 congratulations to the majority#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2014,6,is d which is cosine of pi/6 plus I sine of pi/6 congratulations to the majority of you who correctly answer that very#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2025,1,second most common answer was a which is 1 plus PI sixths and I think that's that's an utterly reasonable guess#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2040,6,circle the number we were going for is like I said sitting pi/6 radians around and from everything we talked about last#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2083,1,interesting um if we pull it up it was a which was 1 plus PI 6 over I let's take a look at where that sits with a I'll#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2092,1,here like I said I've got an infinite supply they were guessing that it's 1 and that instead of walking PI sixths#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2113,30,to use that number to have the action of rotating by 30 degrees it would have an action of rotating by something that's#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2117,30,action of rotating by something that's slightly less than 30 degrees and then they would stretch things out by#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2121,1,something that's slightly more than a factor of 1 but it's actually close which is cool because usually the the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2143,30,we have a number that has this action of a 30 degree rotation I want to bring in of course a friendly PI creature for us#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2158,30,point for whatever reason I want that PI creature to rotate 30 degrees okay I just want them to rotate there's lots of#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2200,3,that would be given the number one minus 3i and then from what you guys just told me in answering the question if we want#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2206,30,to take that point and then figure out where it gets when we rotate 30 degrees about the origin what I should be#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2210,30,about the origin what I should be multiplying it by is cosine of 30 degrees by sine of 30 degrees and if#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2212,30,multiplying it by is cosine of 30 degrees by sine of 30 degrees and if ever you wanted to be convinced that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2233,3,for us to play with and complex numbers if I write something like 3 negative 1 are considered a valid type in this case#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2253,3,imaginary number they use J because again I was kind of already used so 3 minus 1 J you can just read that as#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2256,1,again I was kind of already used so 3 minus 1 J you can just read that as being the same as 3 minus 1 I and I can#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2258,3,minus 1 J you can just read that as being the same as 3 minus 1 I and I can take this number and I can multiply it#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2275,3,foiling it out you can think of this as being the real part is 3 times 4 or 12 minus negative 1 times 2 because#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2278,1,being the real part is 3 times 4 or 12 minus negative 1 times 2 because remember that I squared gives us that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2283,14,remember that I squared gives us that negative so that's where the 14 comes from and then the imaginary part is#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2287,1,from and then the imaginary part is going to be that negative 1 times 4 which is negative 4 plus 3 times 2 which#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2289,4,going to be that negative 1 times 4 which is negative 4 plus 3 times 2 which indeed works out to 2 so that's kind of#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2295,2,which is negative 4 plus 3 times 2 which indeed works out to 2 so that's kind of cool Python seems to be working all of#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2307,3,like his foot sitting here which is that one negative 3 so let's say I define the foot to be sitting at real part 1#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2310,1,one negative 3 so let's say I define the foot to be sitting at real part 1 imaginary part negative 3 the rotating#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2314,3,foot to be sitting at real part 1 imaginary part negative 3 the rotating number that I want Z is what you guys#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2330,30,whose real part is the cosine well I can't write 30 degrees because this will all be in radians so I'll#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2335,30,write it as PI sixths that's the same thing as 30 degrees and then the Y is going to be the sine of that sine of#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2340,6,going to be the sine of that sine of math PI over 6 great so if we look at its components#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2346,0,great so if we look at its components the real part is around 0.866 and the imaginary part should be exactly#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2351,1,and the imaginary part should be exactly 1/2 but you know often you get a little numerical error because computers they#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2364,3,might recognize that that first part is the square root of 3 divided by 2 this is everything we were working out last#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2378,3,or remember foot was that one negative 3z times foot should tell us where it goes when you just go through the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2387,2,where it lands and violently it's supposed to land at around 2.30 real-part#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2390,2,real-part and then negative 2.09 as the imaginary part and indeed when we play that out#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2401,2,looks like the real part is a little above 2 and the imaginary part is a little less than negative 2 and any#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2403,2,above 2 and the imaginary part is a little less than negative 2 and any deviation there is probably because the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2407,1,deviation there is probably because the foot wasn't exactly at that point 1 negative 3 like I said but you can see#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2409,3,foot wasn't exactly at that point 1 negative 3 like I said but you can see what I mean in principle you tell the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2448,2,things you could have everything defined in terms of complex numbers in 2d graphics in 3d graphics that actually#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2451,3,in terms of complex numbers in 2d graphics in 3d graphics that actually wouldn't work#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2473,3,there's errors that come about when you try to use matrices for 3d rotation this thing called gimbal lock talk to any#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2534,75,through words that I want you to calculate for me the cosine of 75 degrees okay and let's go ahead and pull#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2555,75,anything again and that's all it's asking what is the cosine of 75 degrees okay now let me get you started here on#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2559,75,okay now let me get you started here on how you might think about it 75 degrees it's not gonna be based on any triangles#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2568,75,that we might have seen maybe you've seen a 75 degree triangle and you happen to remember what its side lengths were#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2573,75,but most people won't have however what you can do is note that 75 is the same as taking 45 degrees and then walking#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2578,45,you can do is note that 75 is the same as taking 45 degrees and then walking another 30 degrees around okay 45 plus#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2580,30,as taking 45 degrees and then walking another 30 degrees around okay 45 plus 30 degrees and if I#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2584,30,another 30 degrees around okay 45 plus 30 degrees and if I question is asking us for the cosine of#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2588,75,question is asking us for the cosine of 75 one way to think of it is if you first walk 45 degrees around and then#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2591,45,75 one way to think of it is if you first walk 45 degrees around and then you walk another 30 degrees around what#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2594,30,first walk 45 degrees around and then you walk another 30 degrees around what is the x coordinate of that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2603,75,going to have some coordinates XY the cosine of 75 degrees is asking for the x coordinate of that now like I said I#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2621,60,and ponder music and give us I don't know I might give us a full 60 seconds or so to like noodle this one out and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2829,3,after that is B where there's a square root of 3 instead of a square root of 2 okay so we have we actually have a#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2848,75,math test at me right now and it said cosine of 75 you know I would know that in principle I'm supposed to be thinking#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2857,45,of this as in terms of friendlier angles I know that 45 degrees is a friendly angle for trigonometry and I know the 30#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2858,30,I know that 45 degrees is a friendly angle for trigonometry and I know the 30 degrees is what I don't have memorized#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2873,45,fly basically the idea is that we take the complex number associated with a 45 degree rotation which is going to be#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2877,45,degree rotation which is going to be cosine of 45 degrees plus I times the sine of 45 degrees I take that complex#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2883,45,cosine of 45 degrees plus I times the sine of 45 degrees I take that complex number and I'm going to rotate the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2889,30,number and I'm going to rotate the complex number corresponding to a 30 degree rotation so I might even just#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2895,30,pull up yet another unit circle here and say the one that sits 30 degrees away I want to multiply it by this number well#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2907,30,the cosine of that so the real component is the cosine of 30 degrees and then the imaginary component#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2914,30,okay the vertical component here is the sine of 30 degrees which looks like it's you know the smaller leg of a 30-60-90#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2916,30,sine of 30 degrees which looks like it's you know the smaller leg of a 30-60-90 triangle which is going to be one half#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2923,30,moment sine of 30 degrees times i and by the magic of complex multiplication#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2939,45,other so what are these values cosine of 45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2 sine of 45 degrees is the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2941,2,45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2 sine of 45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2 and if you#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2944,2,divided by 2 sine of 45 degrees is the square root of 2 divided by 2 and if you want to if you don't remember that and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2950,45,you want to work it out the way to think about it is that a 45 degree angle is going to create an isosceles right#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2965,1,it's the same as the other side length so if the hypotenuse is 1 we know that x squared plus x squared is supposed to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2969,1,squared plus x squared is supposed to equal 1 that's the Pythagorean theorem that tells us the 2x squared equals 1 so#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2971,2,equal 1 that's the Pythagorean theorem that tells us the 2x squared equals 1 so x squared is the square root of 1/2 and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2975,1,that tells us the 2x squared equals 1 so x squared is the square root of 1/2 and then that's actually the same as writing#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2981,2,then that's actually the same as writing the square root of 2/2 you could also write it as 1 divided by the square root#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2985,1,the square root of 2/2 you could also write it as 1 divided by the square root of 2 if you want but these are these are#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2987,2,write it as 1 divided by the square root of 2 if you want but these are these are equivalent forms so if you forget you#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2991,30,just draw the triangle it's no big deal cosine of 30 degrees well if we have our 30-60-90 triangle the long side of that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,2995,30,cosine of 30 degrees well if we have our 30-60-90 triangle the long side of that from everything we talked through in the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3000,3,from everything we talked through in the last lecture is square root of 3 over 2 square root of 3 over 2 and then the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3002,3,last lecture is square root of 3 over 2 square root of 3 over 2 and then the sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 and now we#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3005,30,square root of 3 over 2 and then the sine of 30 degrees is 1/2 and now we just carry out the complex product it's#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3021,2,okay so that's going to end up being our square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by square root of 3 over 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3026,3,square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by square root of 3 over 2 okay I'm also going to package in when#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3040,2,but it's the same thing so I'm gonna include that square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by the 1/2 but because each#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3044,1,include that square root of 2 over 2 multiplied by the 1/2 but because each of them has an I we also multiply it by#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3052,1,I squared which by definition is negative 1 so we get this negative sign in here and that's going to be the real#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3067,45,the where they drop before here we go if we rotate 45 degrees then we rotated another 30 the X component of that the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3069,30,if we rotate 45 degrees then we rotated another 30 the X component of that the real part is going to be the final#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3079,2,but just for the sake of answering the question this ends up being root 2 times root 3 which is root 6 divided by 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3081,3,question this ends up being root 2 times root 3 which is root 6 divided by 2 times 2 so root 6 over 4 minus and that#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3085,2,root 3 which is root 6 divided by 2 times 2 so root 6 over 4 minus and that minus sign came about because of the I#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3091,2,minus sign came about because of the I squared minus square root of 2 over 4 ok so all in all that ends up being root 6#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3096,6,squared minus square root of 2 over 4 ok so all in all that ends up being root 6 minus root 2 divided by 4 and if we pull#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3099,2,so all in all that ends up being root 6 minus root 2 divided by 4 and if we pull up the question I think it's very#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3128,1,fact that I squared is equal to negative 1 at least if you were going about it using complex numbers which from the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3607,2,ahead and create this alright so the correct answer is a it's root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I it looks like the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3611,2,correct answer is a it's root 2 over 2 plus root 2 over 2 I it looks like the majority of you got that and ok so very#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3630,1,if you think of oh I is defined to be the square root of negative 1 I think a common question is to say you know how#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3637,1,had to make up an answer to the question square root of negative 1 do we have to make up another one for the square root#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3665,2,of try them out and in this case when you try out the square root of 2 over 2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times I and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3669,2,you try out the square root of 2 over 2 plus square root of 2 over 2 times I and you square it so we're going to multiply#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3683,2,possible and that it's not super fun taking root 2 times root 2 for that first real part is going to give us 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3686,2,taking root 2 times root 2 for that first real part is going to give us 2 divided by 2 times 2 so 2 over 4 the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3688,2,first real part is going to give us 2 divided by 2 times 2 so 2 over 4 the real part will also include the products#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3698,2,of the imaginary parts because of that I squared so we're going to have root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 which like we#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3700,2,squared so we're going to have root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 which like we just saw well excuse me that was#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3705,2,just saw well excuse me that was supposed to be 2 over 4 you can tell them a little all over the place today#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3712,2,which you know just because sometimes complex numbers get me excited root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 is going to#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3714,2,complex numbers get me excited root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 is going to be another 2 over 4 but this time it's#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3716,2,over 2 times root 2 over 2 is going to be another 2 over 4 but this time it's times I times I so we're going to have a#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3731,2,something where there was only one I included so to over to I times root 2 over 2 it's the same product we're doing#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3734,2,included so to over to I times root 2 over 2 it's the same product we're doing over and over it's always 2 over 4 and#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3736,2,over 2 it's the same product we're doing over and over it's always 2 over 4 and then we're gonna add 2 root 2 over 2#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3739,2,over and over it's always 2 over 4 and then we're gonna add 2 root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 I so we're gonna add#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3742,2,then we're gonna add 2 root 2 over 2 times root 2 over 2 I so we're gonna add the same thing and I'm not writing the#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3754,0,involves adding them and indeed when we subtract them that real part is 0 and when we add them that imaginary part is#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3759,1,when we add them that imaginary part is 1 so we just get 0 plus I or I and okay it works but imagine that you looked at#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3806,45,what we want is a number that rotates by 45 degrees because if you have a number that rotates by 45 degrees then when you#
en,5PcpBw5Hbwo,3810,45,45 degrees because if you have a number that rotates by 45 degrees then when you multiply by it twice that's the same as#

en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2533,3,back up here we just found cosine of PI sixths which is square root of 3 over 2 but let's answer it for a couple more#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2542,0,dealing only with angles that were between 0 and 90 degrees or I should say between zero and PI halves but let's try#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2552,2,from that and what if I instead said cosine of negative 2 PI over 3 ok now that's one that is hard to think of in#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2580,2,walking all the way around the circle is going to take you a distance of 2 pi and so if you want to think about 2 pi#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2582,2,going to take you a distance of 2 pi and so if you want to think about 2 pi thirds what you might start by doing is#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2689,1729,is the answer a through e sir I think the answer is J 1729 we got Rama Newton's constant oh if I pause it now#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2702,1999,wonderful number they make composite around the year though cuz it's 1999 20 31 okay well I've posited in the#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2705,20,around the year though cuz it's 1999 20 31 okay well I've posited in the future so the correct answer in this#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2728,30,two because it's sort of the difference between things that feel like 30 degree angles and things that feel like 60#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2732,60,between things that feel like 30 degree angles and things that feel like 60 degree angles so let's take a look back#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2740,2,think about this so like I said negative 2 pi divided by 3 that's taking us a negative distance over here and this is#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2762,90,what is this angle okay we know that it's 90 degrees plus something or PI halves plus something and negative 2 PI#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2765,2,it's 90 degrees plus something or PI halves plus something and negative 2 PI over 3 if we wanted to think#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2768,3,halves plus something and negative 2 PI over 3 if we wanted to think in terms of degrees if that's something#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2773,360,we're more comfortable with that's negative 360 divided by three you know degrees which is negative 120 degrees so#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2777,120,negative 360 divided by three you know degrees which is negative 120 degrees so if it takes 120 degrees to get around#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2782,120,degrees which is negative 120 degrees so if it takes 120 degrees to get around here then that minus the 90 degree angle#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2784,90,if it takes 120 degrees to get around here then that minus the 90 degree angle between the X and y axis gives us 30#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2786,30,here then that minus the 90 degree angle between the X and y axis gives us 30 degrees okay so then the question is#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2797,30,the x-coordinate there with your 30-60-90 triangles it's just kind of a nice thing to remember that the shorter#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2802,1,nice thing to remember that the shorter side is 1/2 and the longer side is root 3 over 2 and if you forget why it's#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2806,3,side is 1/2 and the longer side is root 3 over 2 and if you forget why it's exactly the diagram that we just drew#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2819,1,chopping it in half then the shorter side has length 1/2 and then the longer side comes from the Pythagorean theorem#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2835,2,at the very beginning ok associated with cosine squared and cosine of 2 theta and show how that extends our capability for#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2860,2,oscillating more quickly is the same as cosine of 2x that quicker oscillation but we had to kind of shift it and#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2905,1,sine squared of X using the dum-dum convention is 1 plus cosine of 2x this is kind of oscillating more quickly all#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2914,2,is kind of oscillating more quickly all divided by 2 okay so now I'm going to ask you a trickier question which is#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2931,15,keeping track PI twelfths is the same as 15 degrees so if we were doing this with a unit circle what you might think is#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2937,30,a unit circle what you might think is okay a 30 degree angle so it's looking like this that's 30 degrees I'm now#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,2942,30,okay a 30 degree angle so it's looking like this that's 30 degrees I'm now going to be taking half of that a half#

en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3343,3,we just got was the square root of 1 plus the square root of 3 I gotta make sure I do the divided by two correctly /#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3354,2,- right that looks correct but then all of that was divided by 2 all that stuff on the inside was divided by 2 and#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3355,2,of that was divided by 2 all that stuff on the inside was divided by 2 and indeed they're the same value and so#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3479,1,geometric intuitive feel for it and the idea is we take that radius which is 1 and if we think of the fact that tangent#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3492,1,I want a triangle where that adjacent is equal to 1 okay so a right triangle such that this one is the adjacent side to#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3521,1,what we have is a triangle where the adjacent side to theta is 1 and then the opposite side is this length here so#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3538,0,theta is very small when the opposite over adjacent is very close to 0 because that opposite is close to 0 and the#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3541,0,over adjacent is very close to 0 because that opposite is close to 0 and the adjacent is close to 1 well indeed this#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3543,1,that opposite is close to 0 and the adjacent is close to 1 well indeed this length also is getting very close to 0#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3545,0,adjacent is close to 1 well indeed this length also is getting very close to 0 and then you can also think through what#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3549,90,and then you can also think through what happens as that angle approaches 90 degrees this is something I actually#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,3644,3,and take a look okay so again if you go to 3 B 1 B Co /live where the link is in the description you can submit your#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4063,1,that this sits on a circle where x squared plus y squared equals 1 we're just using the definition of cosine#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4082,90,that is that this angle plus something must equal 90 degrees right but this other something plus R theta had to be#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4099,90,angle alpha then we know that alpha plus theta alpha plus theta plus 90 degrees or PI halves if you want to get used to#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4110,180,the better conventions has to equal PI that's got to equal 180 degrees this is maybe confusing just think alpha plus#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4118,90,theta plus PI halves and the back of your mind you can go to 90 degrees if that's something you want for#
en,yBw67Fb31Cs,4129,90,got to be theta because it's alpha plus 90 plus something so that something's got to be theta now the reason I have#

en,MHXO86wKeDY,382,143,because if I asked you hey let's factor 143 I mean how do you go about it I think the way a lot of us think about it#

en,MHXO86wKeDY,453,3599,even met the person and the person just shouts at him factor 3599 you know the program is like alright and he actually#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,480,35,about the numbers that I've chosen here is that 35 is awfully close to a square it's actually just one less than six#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,503,143,something similar happens with the other example I chose 143 is rather close to a square number 144 in fact it's one less#

en,MHXO86wKeDY,541,36,3600 well what is 3600 we recognize the 36 as being six squared and a hundred is 10 squared so that's 60 times#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,542,10,the 36 as being six squared and a hundred is 10 squared so that's 60 times 60 and maybe you think okay the guess if#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,545,60,hundred is 10 squared so that's 60 times 60 and maybe you think okay the guess if it's going to follow the same pattern as#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,553,60,what we've seen above is that this would be one less than 60 times one more than 60 but of course you don't just want a#

en,MHXO86wKeDY,689,59,numbers that we had is something that's like 59 and 61 on a number line and I want to think in terms of the midpoint M#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,703,1,each of the other numbers so plus and minus D in this case D is just 1 but in principle it might be something more so#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,770,101,number line and I don't know wait I say look at 101102 103 and I just say take a look at all the numbers on the number#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,847,3,BX plus C okay for any numbers a B and C so maybe that's something like 3x squared minus 4x plus 5 and you want to#

en,MHXO86wKeDY,853,0,squared minus 4x plus 5 and you want to know when that equals 0 what are the two roots now this is actually equivalent to#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,869,1,just want that first coefficient to be a 1 because that's way easier to work with so I'm gonna call that x squared plus B#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,894,2,parabola in this case I've written it so that one of the roots is going to be 2 and the other is 4 and then G of X here#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,895,4,that one of the roots is going to be 2 and the other is 4 and then G of X here is just the scaled version of the#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,927,2,different function but the roots are still 2 & 4 okay so solving for this rescaled version of the#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,934,0,quadratic is the same and I should kind of make sense because s times 0 is always going to be 0 so it doesn't#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,937,0,of make sense because s times 0 is always going to be 0 so it doesn't matter how much we scale it so going#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,940,2,matter how much we scale it so going back to 2 what we're working with here the reason that I think it's much nicer#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,946,1,to make sure that that leading coefficient is a 1 is because if we're thinking of our quadratic in terms of#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,972,0,times X minus s because if I plug in R it's clear that we're going to get 0 and if I plug in s again this term will also#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,976,0,if I plug in s again this term will also cancel out to 0 so if I expand this whatever R and s are there are the#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,995,1,circumstance where that leading coefficient is 1 and the whole polynomials been kind of normalized in#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1075,7,circumstances if you have something like you know x squared let's see minus 7x plus 12 basically say see if you can#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1080,12,you know x squared let's see minus 7x plus 12 basically say see if you can guess and find two different numbers#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1088,12,that add up to be seven and that multiply to be 12 and if you just kind of sit back there and think you're like#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1093,7,okay can I find any two numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12 well factoring 12 we get 3 & 4 & 3 & 4#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1095,12,to 7 and multiply to 12 well factoring 12 we get 3 & 4 & 3 & 4 do add to 7 so yeah in that case you're#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1099,7,well factoring 12 we get 3 & 4 & 3 & 4 do add to 7 so yeah in that case you're just totally luck out and you could#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1103,3,just totally luck out and you could write this as X minus 3 and X minus 4 because those are the two roots and then#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1178,6,x squared I don't know mmm let's do 6 even numbers we'll make this easier for us and then 7 okay and#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1181,7,mmm let's do 6 even numbers we'll make this easier for us and then 7 okay and you were tasked with knowing when does#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1187,0,you were tasked with knowing when does this equal 0 but I haven't told you how to solve it yet but these three key#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1264,9,equal to M Squared which in our example turns out to be 9 minus C prime which is that last coefficient or 7 well 7#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1267,7,turns out to be 9 minus C prime which is that last coefficient or 7 well 7 handwriting is terrible#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1279,2,you see why I usually animate stuff so that means that's 2 so look when we said R and s is some midpoint plus or minus a#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1283,3,R and s is some midpoint plus or minus a distance that midpoint is negative 3 plus or minus#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1287,2,plus or minus well if d squared is 2 that means D is the square root of 2 there you go you#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1290,2,well if d squared is 2 that means D is the square root of 2 there you go you could do that for any quadratic that I#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1313,1,rescaled version of b if the leading coefficient wasn't already 1/2 and then that distance well what did we just do#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1394,3,questions and then you'll be able to go to 3 B 1 B Co /live and answer them but because there's too many of you we can't#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1404,20,a class where you have you know I don't know 20 seats sitting out and you're gonna do a normal lecture and then#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1428,10,process looks like let's say we had x squared plus 10 X plus 3 so in this case it's nicely already rescaled for us#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1507,25,product which in this context is negative five squared or 25 minus the product which is that last coefficient#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1516,5,minus three so what are the roots R and s well it's negative 5 plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 3 or 22 there#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1521,25,s well it's negative 5 plus or minus the square root of 25 minus 3 or 22 there you go#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1565,3,that way I don't know what should we do let's do maybe 3x squared I think I wrote one down earlier didn't I just as#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1578,3,oh yeah was at the top let's do that one 3x squared minus 4x plus 5y not 3x squared minus 4x plus 5 all right so in#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1583,4,3x squared minus 4x plus 5y not 3x squared minus 4x plus 5 all right so in this case step one we've got to rescale#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1594,4,coefficients a nice readable meaning - 4/3 x + 5/3 great and now same process I'm sort of thinking in my head of this#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1611,2,that midpoint is negative of this second coefficient divided by 2 so that will become positive 4/3#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1613,4,coefficient divided by 2 so that will become positive 4/3 but then that 4 divided by 2 gives us a#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1615,4,become positive 4/3 but then that 4 divided by 2 gives us a 2 so that midpoint will be 2/3 and then#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1618,2,but then that 4 divided by 2 gives us a 2 so that midpoint will be 2/3 and then the distance squared is M Squared minus#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1625,5,the distance squared is M Squared minus the product which in this case is 5/3 okay an M Squared in this case is let's#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1632,2,okay an M Squared in this case is let's see 2/3 squared minus 5/3 all right so this one you know gets a little Messier#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1640,2,we've got a work out our fractions but that's not too bad 2/3 squared is going to be 4/9 I'm off screen a little and#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1643,4,that's not too bad 2/3 squared is going to be 4/9 I'm off screen a little and then what is 5/3 in terms of Knights#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1650,5,to be 4/9 I'm off screen a little and then what is 5/3 in terms of Knights that's going to be 15 ninths if I'm not#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1653,15,then what is 5/3 in terms of Knights that's going to be 15 ninths if I'm not wrong so we end up getting a negative#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1660,11,number which is always fun so here we have negative 11 9th okay so what that means is that our final answer the roots#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1669,0,of this polynomial R and s the values that will make the polynomial 0 are going to be 2/3 plus or minus the square#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1671,2,that will make the polynomial 0 are going to be 2/3 plus or minus the square root of negative 11 over D negative 11#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1676,11,going to be 2/3 plus or minus the square root of negative 11 over D negative 11 over d d what am I saying negative 11#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1680,11,root of negative 11 over D negative 11 over d d what am I saying negative 11 over 9 okay so that's fun#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1683,9,over d d what am I saying negative 11 over 9 okay so that's fun in this case the square root is a#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1717,6,with nice numbers here I mean nice-ish x squared minus 6x plus 10#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1723,10,I mean nice-ish x squared minus 6x plus 10 okay so we go through the same rigmarole#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1802,3,one two three four so in this case our two roots live at three plus I and 3 minus I so this I should be very clear#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,1855,1,three squared plus the other length squared which is 1 squared so square root of three squared plus one#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2110,0,now so let's work it out again ax squared plus BX plus C equals 0 this time we're just going to write#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2150,2,term divided by two so in this case that's going to be negative B over 2a great and then that standard deviation#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2164,2,product of the roots which in this case looks like negative B over 2a squared - and the product here is what that last#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2235,2engrained we'll go back to two lines negative B divided by 2a divided by 2a plus or minus the square root I wrote#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2262,2,so what we have here well it's going to be the square of negative B over 2a minus C over a minus C over a okay now#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2286,2,formula to it for us so I can pull out this 2a squared and I'm just gonna write that as 1 over 4a x times negative B#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2288,1,this 2a squared and I'm just gonna write that as 1 over 4a x times negative B squared negative B yeah negative B#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2301,1,squared and then I want to also pull out 1 over 4a I want to be able to say that the last term also looks like 1 over 4a#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2303,1,1 over 4a I want to be able to say that the last term also looks like 1 over 4a times something and that's something to#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2311,4,make it equal to C over a would have to cancel out the 4 it would have to cancel out an extra a and then C sorry because#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2317,1,out an extra a and then C sorry because this is really 1 over 4a squared let's see if I'd done this right yeah#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2322,2,let's see if I'd done this right yeah because I pulled out the 2 a so that should be 4 times a squared so over here#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2324,4,because I pulled out the 2 a so that should be 4 times a squared so over here I have 4 times a squared I want that to#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2325,4,should be 4 times a squared so over here I have 4 times a squared I want that to cancel to become C over a which it looks#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2334,2,like it does so that's awesome so I can go over here negative B over 2a plus or minus and if this feels tedious that's#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2354,1,properly okay so what can we do here we can factor out the 1 over 4a squared and because that's in a radical it's square#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2359,1,because that's in a radical it's square root will also be 1 over 2a and then what sits inside is what remains the#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2367,4,well familiar at negative B squared minus 4a ok and this this is starting to look like the traditional form because#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2386,4,B squared what should sit on the inside here is b squared minus 4ac for AC you can see how scatterbrained I#
en,MHXO86wKeDY,2667,1724,big fan you might say I'm rooting for it so it looks like 1724 of you 5 short of Ramanujan's constant are addicted to#

estimate these depth maps even if we have#

now create these 3D photographs where we get even more information out of one still
image.#
en,MrIbQ0pIFOg,118,3,The key difference here is that this new technique
uses a learning method and does this image inpainting in 3D and it not only fills in
color but depth information as well. What a crazy amazing idea.#

en,tg_m_LxxRwM,3189,15,on is these kinds of captures in 2014 15. got that kind of stuff right right so#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,3787,100,the training set is almost uh you know 100 x 1000 x bigger than uh the test set in many many cases#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,3867,60,saying rather than train on 60000 uh training data#

en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5432,3,got it speaking of which if we could uh talk about gpt3 a little bit i think it's an interesting#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5453,175,this recently released very large 175 billion parameter language model#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5473,2,part of that was already evident in gpt2 you know that it can generate cochrane#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5510,3,will happen less than gpt 3 because it is trained on even more data and#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5553,10,about gpt three i'm talking about gpt four five and gpt 10. yeah i mean they will look#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5556,3,will look more impressive than gpg3 so you can if you take that to the extreme then#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5934,100,it's just that i don't want to dogmatically like 100 percent put all the chips there right it's we've#
en,tg_m_LxxRwM,5940,2,been surprised so much even the current gpt 2 and 3 are so surprising yeah uh#

en,amXXYgu0eFY,85,127,parameter that's 127 as a default and what that does is create a cache of integer#

en,brslF-Cy3HU,2834,10,have this sense of yeah even the papers i wrote 10 years ago they were awesome at the time#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,2863,200,uh impactful papers and ideas when people look back 200 years from now at your work what#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3072,99,are actually conserved 99 of our genome does not code for protein#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3079,99,one percent codes for protein the other 99 we frankly didn't know what it does#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3097,17,apply them to flies apply them to four mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply them to 12 drosophila species#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3099,12,mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply them to 12 drosophila species apply them to them 29 mammals and now#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3101,29,them to 12 drosophila species apply them to them 29 mammals and now 200 mammals#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3103,200,apply them to them 29 mammals and now 200 mammals so sorry so can we so the evolutionary#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3143,60,and mammals evolved from a common ancestor about 60 million years back so after you know the#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3192,20,i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of 20 20 left so if i think no no but think about it this way#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3198,175,so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years we humans have been around for#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3227,154,impact than we did yeah and um if you if you give us another 154 million years#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3460,2,evolutionary signatures and applied it on the sarsko v2 genome that is responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3463,19,on the sarsko v2 genome that is responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3466,44,responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus species so this is#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3483,44,yeah so it was that family by the way we have 44 species that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3484,24,have 44 species that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus is a clever#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3489,44,is a clever no no but but there's just 44 and again we don't call them species#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3494,44,in in viruses we call them strange but anyway there's 44 strains and that's a tiny little subset of you#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3498,50,and that's a tiny little subset of you know maybe another 50 strains that are just far too distantly related#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3528,10,are not and what we found is that orf10 the last little#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3554,3,that within or 3a lies a tiny little additional gene encoded within the other#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3580,2,so we don't even know the building blocks of sarsko v2 so if we want to understand coronavirus#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3602,19,if it's okay uh is uh can we talk about uh the the kovic 19 a little bit more like how what's your sense about the the#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3613,19,understand about covet 19 where do we stand in in your sense#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3648,30,set for every one of these proteins so the genome has you know 30 some genes some genes evolve super super fast#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3671,2,this is the part of the spike protein that actually touches the h2 receptor and then enables the virus to attach#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3688,1,part of the protein s1 which basically attaches to the h2 receptor#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3692,2,receptor and then s2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels the fusion of the#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3705,30,inside our cells which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins so the s1 protein is evolving#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3708,1,translated into all of these 30 proteins so the s1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast so if you look at#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3721,8,pedal is all the way down or 8 is also evolving super fast and or six is evolving super fast we have no#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3729,1,we have some idea but nowhere near what s1 is so what the isn't that terrifying that#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3732,1,so what the isn't that terrifying that s1 is evol that means that's a really useful function and if#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3760,1,these cervical viruses the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly because it's attaching to different#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,3772,2,adjust one to the new ace2 receptor that you're going to be facing in that new species#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4085,30,it tricks your cells into making 30 proteins from a single rna#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4160,20,because that one protein as it's growing gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4209,20,more and more of them that's the first 20 proteins in fact halfway down about#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4213,11,halfway down about protein 11 between you know 11 and 12 you basically have a translational#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4225,1,about half of them are going to be translated from 1 to 11 and the other half are going to be#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4226,11,translated from 1 to 11 and the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16.#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4228,12,11 and the other half are going to be translated from 12 to 16. wow it's gorgeous and then#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4366,30,explain the black death killed what 30 of europe that has left a tremendous imprint#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4512,1,non-immune things if you look at our adipocytes m1 versus m2 macrophages inside our fat#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4515,2,if you look at our adipocytes m1 versus m2 macrophages inside our fat will basically determine whether you're#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4634,44,in africa they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow that's fascinating#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4685,44,it's still the minor allele but it's at 44 frequency in southeast asia 42 frequency in europe#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4687,42,44 frequency in southeast asia 42 frequency in europe even though it started at 2#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4690,2,in southeast asia 42 frequency in europe even though it started at 2 it was an awesome allele to have 100#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4692,100,even though it started at 2 it was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4887,1,matched in lab because the s1 protein has three different components each of which has a#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4904,1,throughout the coronavirus tree so basically the s1 protein has been recombining across species all the time#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4922,1,a new hybrid virus with recombination that now has the s1 from one and the rest of the genome from another#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,4927,1,and this is something that happens a lot in s1 you know fade etc and that's something that's#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5138,2020,something we could do to strengthen our immune system in 2020 is there like uh you know exercise#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5321,3,mentioned earlier and its target genes irx3 and rx5 that basically switch your adipocytes#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5475,24,and i've basically gone through periods of 24 hours without eating or stopping and you know then i'm like oh must eat#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5834,12,five hundred twenty seven in chromosome 12. you instead have content based indexing so at every#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5947,20,you'd be in trouble if i take the genome and i flip 20 of the letters you probably won't even#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5981,19,to the most terrifying genome like i don't know kovit-19 sarsko v2 and the current pandemic#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,5983,2,don't know kovit-19 sarsko v2 and the current pandemic you basically see this elegance as#

en,brslF-Cy3HU,6181,16,having eight chromosomes you can now have 16 chromosomes so but with the duplication at first#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,6188,16,when you have six when you go to 16 you're not using that#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,6196,16,you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes probably a non-disjunction event during#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,6260,10,copy of most of your genes and a small number 10 were kept in two copies and those had to do a lot with#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,6280,20,you know the example that i was giving of messing with 20 of your bits in your computer totally#
en,brslF-Cy3HU,6408,614,is what happens in specific mutations so if you look at the d614 gene mutation that's been all over the news so#

en,KllCrlfLuzs,458,180,it's um as up to 180 uh you you start at a corner and draw#

en,KllCrlfLuzs,1286,180,the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees yeah it's a nice escape from the#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,1327,1955,so just to link on the historical note as a phd student in 1955 he joined the computational lab at#

en,KllCrlfLuzs,1392,60,computers this is already in the 60s no in the mid 50s in mid 50s#

en,KllCrlfLuzs,1396,50,50s in mid 50s or mid late 50s there was already usual computers in there yeah we had a univac#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,1400,2000,computers in there yeah we had a univac a 2000 univac with 2000 words of storage#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,1401,2000,a 2000 univac with 2000 words of storage and so you had to work hard to allocate#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,1459,60,giant computers could you imagine that 60 years later would have billions of these computers#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,1939,10,that goes from the mark one computer to a an iphone 10. yeah so do you think it would be we#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,3116,50,mathematics and even more so in the last 50 years since the#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,3157,91,uh so if we can factor the a number like 91 that's 7 times 13 but if i give you#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,3166,20,but if i give you 20 digit or 30 digit numbers you're probably going to be at a loss to#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,3630,1971,when he published it in a conference in 1971. yeah so when i saw uh cook's paper and#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,4078,1971,right and what i did in the 1971 paper was to take#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,4083,21,take 21 fundamental problems commonly occurring problems of packing#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,4159,15,or no there is a clique of size 15 or there's not a clique of size 15.#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,4161,15,there is a clique of size 15 or there's not a clique of size 15. on the other hand an optimization#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,4173,15,not be yes or no it would be 15. so um so when you're asking for the#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,5216,17,[Music] 17 is prime i could pick any number between#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,5223,1,i could pick any number between 1 and 17 and raise it to the 16th power modulo 17 and you should get back the#
en,KllCrlfLuzs,5228,17,1 and 17 and raise it to the 16th power modulo 17 and you should get back the original number#

en,LRYkH-fAVGE,205,10,summer vision project to be given as far as we know to 10 students to work on and solve that summer#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,390,50,step there are many problems in vision where getting 50 of the solution you can get in one#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,394,90,of the solution you can get in one minute getting to 90 percent can take you a day getting to 99 percent#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,397,99,minute getting to 90 percent can take you a day getting to 99 percent may take you five years and#

en,LRYkH-fAVGE,672,1980,there were demonstrations of that going back to the 1980s by someone called ernst stickmans in munich#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,679,90,someone called ernst stickmans in munich in the 90s there were approaches from carnegie mellon there were approaches#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,684,2000,from our team at berkeley in the 2000s there were approaches from stanford#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,718,50,open problem because uh it applies the same 50 90 95 99 rule or the first step the fallacy of the#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1002,16,it is not tabular assad learning so at the age of 16 in high school uh a teenager goes into uh#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1016,16,at that point they learn but at the age of 16 they are already visual geniuses because from 0 to 16 they have built a#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1020,0,of 16 they are already visual geniuses because from 0 to 16 they have built a certain repertoire of vision#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1028,2,achieved by age 2 right in in this period of age up to age 2 they know that the world is#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1032,2,age 2 right in in this period of age up to age 2 they know that the world is three-dimensional they know how#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1059,16,reinforced through their their growing up to age 16. so then#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1062,16,then at age 16 when they go into driver ed what are they learning they're not#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1297,20,uh so so this is a point i've been making for 20 years now and i think once upon a time the way i#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1342,2020,are now talking about 2020 we do have if you consider the latest gpus and so on#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1354,1990,back at enhanced modex type of calculations which he did in the 1990s we may be there today in terms of#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1416,3,into whether segmentation 3d reconstruction object detection i don't know image capturing whatever uh#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1470,500,which arose in the cambrian era you know 500 million years ago and uh these animals could move#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1579,500,in you know an animal 500 million years ago once we have this#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1600,3,code module of object detection or quote this module of 3d reconstruction what's going on is really all of these#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1844,70,computer vision community uh through the 70s 80s 90s can be understood as#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1884,256,image right so you have an image which i say 256 by 256 pixels and instead of keeping around the grayscale#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,1962,90,essentially the techniques you used in in the 90s some very basic computer vision techniques#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2007,10,statement that to me video recognition feels like 10 years behind#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2019,30,their performance on action classification is like say 30 which is kind of what we used to have#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2027,2009,around 2009 in object detection you know so it's like about 10 years behind#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2030,10,2009 in object detection you know so it's like about 10 years behind and uh whether it'll take 10 years to#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2032,10,it's like about 10 years behind and uh whether it'll take 10 years to catch up is a different question#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2113,1970,bill arrives etc etc this is a classic example of ai from the 1970s uh it was called there was the term#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2124,70,similar ideas okay in the 70s the way the ai of the time dealt with it was by#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2174,3,right now with 3d convolutions over a couple of seconds of clip or video#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2204,70,how will we bring that in so we could either revert back to the 70s and say okay i'm going to hand code in#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2253,10,they go to the restaurant they eat come back and the child goes through 10 such experiences#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2684,80,right so the in the early days back going back to the 80s and 90s they were they were focusing on visual realism#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2989,50,so the kinds of neural networks we are using in computer vision say a resnet 50 has 50 layers#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,2992,50,using in computer vision say a resnet 50 has 50 layers well in in the brain in the visual#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,3635,3,well to for example see impute some 3d objects corresponding to each of these#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,3651,2010,i mean i started pushing this kind of a view in the around 2010 or something like that#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,3936,3,so the touch signal is is getting as the notion of 3d shape but it is sparse#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4084,1,which links the two right so at a certain moment t1 you've got a certain signal in the#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4162,500,right so you we have vision that developed 500 million years ago okay then something like when we get to#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4182,500,objects and build tools and so on and so forth so you said 500000 years ago no no sorry#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4190,500,which you can say had some intelligence arose 500 million years ago#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4446,1950,i think i think turing test that turing as he proposed the test in 1950 was trying to solve a certain problem#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4456,70,sense then where we are today 70 years later i think i think we#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4480,10,okay i think i would rather have a list of 10 different tasks i mean i think their tasks which their tasks in the#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4575,1900,performance in the real world so david hilbert in 1900 proposed 23 open problems in mathematics some of#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4595,2015,i don't know when the last year you presented that 2015 but versions of it yeah you're kind of the the face and the#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4666,50,we can't do it fully accurately if we can do it at 50 percent maybe next year we'll do it at 65 and so forth#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4668,65,if we can do it at 50 percent maybe next year we'll do it at 65 and so forth but i think the long range video#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4711,3,will talk about say understanding the world in 3d now this may seem#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4719,3,paradoxical because in a way we have been able to do 3d understanding even like#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4721,30,like 30 years ago right but i don't think we currently have the richness of#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4727,3,currently have the richness of 3d understanding in our computer vision system that we would like#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4769,3,community which try to guess 3d from single views and these techniques are based#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4780,3,time 3d models of objects available and this is completely unnatural#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4800,3,uh learning as you move around the world uh notion of 3d so so we we have our#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4836,3,chair and i have a guess of what its 3d shape is like#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,4875,3,understanding that do for example achieve this kind of 3d understanding and you don't know how they you don't#

en,LRYkH-fAVGE,5104,2000,what touring thought actually we could do by a year 2000 right what do you think we'll ever be#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,5121,20,answer is a pragmatic one do you think we will be able to do it in the next 20 years#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,5212,2010,in 2010 i think what we knew from the mathematical#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,5313,10,uh really unwarranted are these these fears of uh you know agi in 10 years and 20 years and#
en,LRYkH-fAVGE,5316,20,these fears of uh you know agi in 10 years and 20 years and that kind of stuff because that's based#

en,O9upVbGSBFo,282,1969,the gist of it is that at Bell Labs and in 1969 there were a group of people who had just finished working on the multics#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,302,1966,used it as that summer I spent in Cambridge in 1966 for was the hardware there right so what's the operating#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,326,1950,sharing systems yeah if we go back into let's call it the 1950s and early 1960s most computing was done on very big#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,441,64,first of these it was done I guess technically 64 or something like that it ran on an IBM 7090 for slightly modified#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,444,7090,technically 64 or something like that it ran on an IBM 7090 for slightly modified to have twice as much memory as the norm#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,450,32,to have twice as much memory as the norm it had two banks of 32 k words instead of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,454,32,it had two banks of 32 k words instead of one so 32 K words yes where's this 36 bit so call it you know about a hundred#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,485,66,bunch of other folks and then so I spent the summer of 66 working on that had a great time met a lot of really nice#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,575,50,like cloud computing today yeah same idea but 50 odd years earlier and so what multix offered was a richer#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,618,50,an intern first summer but my sense is given that it was over 50 years ago yeah they had that idea that it was an#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,721,15,Providence and Berkeley Heights think of it as about 15-20 miles straight west of New York City and therefore but an hour#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,837,66,computing as well is when I was there I went there first in 66 so computing was at that point fairly young and so people#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,870,1969,delivered much too late and so in roughly the beginning of 1969 Bell Labs pulled out of the project the project at#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,922,7,at the same time Ken Thompson found what is characterized as a little-used pdp-7 where he started to do experiments with#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,966,16,numbers exactly but it had a very small amount of memory maybe 16 K 16-bit words or something like that relatively slow#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,991,1964,in any case in it came out if I recall in 1964 so by 1969 it was getting a little obsolete and that's why it was#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1063,7,for pdp-7 that worked he needed a text editor so that he could actually create#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1086,7,primarily the programming language was it in assembly pdp-7 assembler that Ken created these things were assembly#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1092,1973,created these things were assembly language until probably the call at 1973 or 74 something like that yeah#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1096,74,language until probably the call at 1973 or 74 something like that yeah forgive me if it's a dumb question but#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1525,50,room oh how big was it probably call it 50 feet by 50 feet make up a number of that#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1529,50,oh how big was it probably call it 50 feet by 50 feet make up a number of that and which had some access to computers#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1691,80,amount of legal jockeying around this that in the late early to late 80s Early 90s something like that and then not#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1695,90,that in the late early to late 80s Early 90s something like that and then not something that I guess the open source#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1706,80,Stallman started to think about this in the late 80s and by 1991 when Torvalds decided he was going to do a unix-like#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1879,9,the world processes become in effect files in a file system and the plan 9 operating system which came along I#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1884,80,operating system which came along I guess in the late 80s or something like that#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,1893,9,generalization even further so that in plan 9 a lot of different resources our file systems they all share that#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2128,70,on Peter Weinberger we did that originally in the late 70s it was a language that was meant to make#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2188,40,it's kept going as long as it has because at this point it's over 40 years old but it's still I think a useful tool#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2300,5,a program which in another language let's say Python would be 5 10 20 lines in Arcis one or two lines and so because#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2429,90,machines but somewhere in roughly the 90s windows became a graphical system and I think Microsoft spent a lot of#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2484,20,on Windows and so that's a something that's been going on for at least 20 years if not longer and I use that on my#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2536,13,by default I have a at this point a 13-inch MacBook Air which I used because it's kind of a reasonable balance of the#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2736,70,joy and so that dates from probably the late 70s as a guess and it took at full advantage of the cursor controls I#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2806,40,could say programming languages started probably in what the late 40s or something like that people used to#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2859,40,and dropped into memory and they were early on and this would be the late 40s and very early 50s there were assemblers#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2862,50,early on and this would be the late 40s and very early 50s there were assemblers written for the various machines that#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2899,1950,languages learn let's call at the early 1950s and so every different flavor of computer has its own assembly language#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2905,70,so the EDSAC head hits in a manchester head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or 704 or whatever had hits and so on so#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2909,704,head it and the IBM whatever 70 90 or 704 or whatever had hits and so on so everybody had their own assembly like#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,2944,50,start over okay so very bad and so what happened in the late 50s was people realize you could play this game again#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3062,70,particular kind of computer and then in the 70s you get system programming languages of which C is the survivor and#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3116,60,languages there was a lot of effort in that and call it the late 60s early 70s C is I think the only real survivor of#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3203,50,as powerful as they are today again put yourself back 50 years almost in terms of what computers could do#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3289,1977,clearly I timing was good now Denison I wrote the book in 1977 I miss ritchi yeah right and at that point#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3609,21,like see it's sometimes characterized to see for the 21st century on the surface it looks very very much like see but at#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3629,90,go expert in spite of co-authoring the book about 90% of the work was done by Alan Donovan and my co-author who is a#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3647,40,processes that Tony Hoare set forth I don't know 40-plus years ago and go routines are to my mind a very natural#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3674,4,very easy and nice just to comment on that do you think c4 saw or the early unique States foresaw threads and#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3745,20,many languages as I possibly can I've got it in 20 on languages at this point and and that's so I do a minimal#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3757,15,understand the task and it should it takes 15 lines in awk and not much more in a variety of other languages so how#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3803,60,of varying lengths and it puts them out in lines that have no more than 60 characters on each line so think it was#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,3835,90,several weeks but it did run like a turtle and and I did it in Fortran 90 and it painful but it worked and I tried#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4143,95,there's something called a dozen languages that probably count for 95% of all programming at this point and that#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4152,2000,doesn't seem unreasonable and then there's another well 2000 languages that are still in use that nobody uses and or#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4464,1984,um and so Bob spent a sabbatical year at Bell Labs in 1984 and he and wasn't in the office across from me and it's#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4530,3,fairly quickly we wrote it was you know 3000 lines or something so it wasn't very big but it just sort of showed the#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4623,84,or what so we did that in 84 and I haven't had a lot to do with it since except that we#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,4665,70,Labs in this same period of the very early 70s oh that predates tech and things like#

en,O9upVbGSBFo,5777,5,so in a way I'm expecting them to make an enormous conceptual leap from their 5 or 10 line toy assembly language thing#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,5779,10,an enormous conceptual leap from their 5 or 10 line toy assembly language thing that adds two or three numbers to you#
en,O9upVbGSBFo,5835,60,because it cost serious money and this was in the 60s right and today people don't make phone calls they send texts#
